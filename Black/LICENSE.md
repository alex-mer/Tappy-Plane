The terms of your license agreement with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content will govern all matters related to your usage of the Third Party Licensor Content rather than the terms of this Agreement.

**5. ROYALTY**

To receiveCommercial Licenses in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 **(LICENSE GRANT)** you agree to pay Massive Heights a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal entity, as follows:

a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to the end-users through any and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;

b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by the end-users for use with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a Product or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;

c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);

d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;

e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise);

f. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).

Commercial License may be temporarily not available for you or its accessibility to you can be bound to release of a certain version (versions) of Black Engine and or Smith Editor.

However, no royalty is owed on the revenue that is not over than $10 000 (USD) in a quarter and if provided Splash Screen demonstration which sample is setted (or recommended) by Massive Heights for a period of not less than 3 seconds. Providing the specified conditions (the revenue is not over than $10 000 (USD) in a quarter and demonstration of Splash Screen for a period of not less than 3 seconds) you are granted an Indie type of license. In case of non-fulfillment of the requirements or non-compliance with the conditions for obtaining an Indie License, you are obliged to pay in favor of Massive Heights in the amount of 5% of your gross revenue, taking into account the requirements below.

The royalty is based on gross revenue from the end-users, regardless of whether you sell your Product to the end-users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store, or work with a publisher.  The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales:  if your Product earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may pay you $7 (having deducted 30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty to Massive Heights would still be 5% of $10 (or $0.50).

Royalties that you pay on an advance payment of the revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under this Agreement for that Product.

Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a Product earns the revenue except the case when you are using Indie type of the license, you must pay to Massive Heights the full amount of the royalty due to that quarter and send Massive Heights a royalty report on a per Product basis.

The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any Engine Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to make the Product are protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.

**6. PAYMENTS**

Massive Heights reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due to date.

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this Agreement (other than taxes that Massive Heights is obligated to pay on its income, which are Massive Heights&#39;s responsibility).

Massive Heights may conduct reasonable audits of those books and records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior notice to you.
